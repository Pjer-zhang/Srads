# **S**olar **Ra**dio  **D**ata processing **s**cripts

 [SRaDs] (**S**)olar (**Ra**)dio  (**D**)ata processing (**s**)cripts

All scripts In order to avoid the comflict with any build in function or script namespace, here we use 'srads_' as prefix

## 0)  General useful functions

This scripts stores in the SRADs/gen/ dir
### 0.1) overlay a solar latitude-longitude grid

As the title said this is a simple funtion to overlay a lat-lon grid to a excisting image, it's can be called like:

```matlab
gen_plot_helio(par);
```

## 1)  SRS File Visualization (Learmonth)

According to official SRS(SOLAR RADIO SPECTROGRAPH)  document from IPS Radio and Space Services, we decode the SRS file and finally visualized it, we can use this script to read and visualize the **Learmonth radio spectrographs** dataï¼š

This script is named as "srads_plot_srs.m"

its a function and can be called as:

```matlab
srads_plot_srs('path/to/file/LMxxxxxx.srs'); 
% just plot

data = srads_plot_srs('path/to/file/LMxxxxxx.srs');
% plot it and save intensity infomation to 'data'

[data, t, f] = srads_plot_srs('path/to/file/LMxxxxxx.srs'); 
% plot it and save intensity infomation to 'data' and 
% save frequency axis to 'f' and save t axis to 't'
```

And the data can be selected and downloaded at [Data form](http://www.sws.bom.gov.au/World_Data_Centre/1/9) and it can be downloaded directly via ftp service at ftp://ftp-out.sws.bom.gov.au/wdc/wdc_spec/

Official site of Space weather service also provided a windows(32) version of SRS display software to display the data (not open source) The Software SRSDisplay.exe (can be downloaded from [Tool download site](http://www.sws.bom.gov.au/World_Data_Centre/1/1))

## 2) World Spec Data (Culgoora)
Data from Culgoora can be handled in the same way, so there is another script for it and can be used in the similar way.

This script is named as "srads_plot_spec.m"

Just like srs data, this is also a function and can be called like 

```matlab
srads_plot_spec('path/to/file/SPECxxxxxx'); 
% just plot

data = srads_plot_spec('path/to/file/SPECxxxxxx');
% plot it and save intensity infomation to 'data'

[data, t, f] = srads_plot_spec('path/to/file/SPECxxxxxx'); 
% plot it and save intensity infomation to 'data' and 
% save frequency axis to 'f' and save t axis to 't'
```


And the data can be selected and downloaded at [Data form](http://www.sws.bom.gov.au/World_Data_Centre/1/9) and it can be downloaded directly via ftp service at  ftp://ftp-out.sws.bom.gov.au/wdc/wdc_spec/data/culgoora/raw/

Software tool of displaying the raw data (spec.zip) can also be downloaded from [Tool download site](http://www.sws.bom.gov.au/World_Data_Centre/1/1))

## 3) Bleien solar radio data
This is a set of observation instrument including Phoenix-3, Phoenix-4 and e-Callisto, there have already been scripts in SSW(solar software) and some [Java GUI](http://soleil.i4ds.ch/solarradio/data/JavaViewers/) to display the data for quick look in data (not analyzing tool).

Here we also provide a script to decode and display the spectra data saved in fits file.

The script is named as "srads_plot_bleien.m"

Just like srs data, this is also a function and can be called like 

```matlab
srads_plot_bleien('path/to/file/xxxxxx.fit'); 
% just plot

data = srads_plot_bleien('path/to/file/xxxxxx.fit');
% plot it and save intensity infomation to 'data'

[data, t, f] = srads_plot_bleien('path/to/file/xxxxxx.fit'); 
% plot it and save intensity infomation to 'data' and 
% save frequency axis to 'f' and save t axis to 't'
```

And in this script a function to eleminate the background is used, considering the background doesn't change too much so we can eliminate it by remove average from the data, and this function is written as an independent function for other scripts to use.

This function is called "constback_sub.m"

And it can be called as:


```matlab
res = constback_sub(raw);
```

## 4) Nobeyama Radioheliograph

The product data of Nobeyama Radioheliograph with clean graph is in fits format (but the data files do not have the '.fits' extension), header infomation can be read from the data file, and we can get more detailed information from the data defination document: http://solar.nro.nao.ac.jp/norh/doc/man_v33e.pdf


## 5) Nancay NDA

Nancay data is in binary form, official data reading script ```OPEN_ROU_A.PRO``` provided by instrument team.

I wrote a a script ```preprocess_convert_nancay_fits.pro``` to convert nancay data into fits file, which is more commonly used and could be read into all data processing tools (Python, Matlab, etc.)
